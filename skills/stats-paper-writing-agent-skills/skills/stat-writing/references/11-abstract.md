# Abstract guidance (statistical papers)

## Non‑negotiable constraints (default)
- Target **4–10 sentences** (a common sweet spot is **6–8**).
- The abstract should be **self‑contained**.
- **No citations** in the abstract.
- **No math notation** (no equations, no heavy symbols). Replace with words.

## What the abstract must answer
Think of an abstract as “the whole paper in miniature.” It should make a reader understand:
1) **Why the problem matters** (context + importance)
2) **What is missing** in existing work (gap)
3) **What you contribute** (novelty / contribution)
4) **What you did** (core idea of methods)
5) **What evidence you provide** (theory / simulation / application)
6) **What you found** (main results—no overclaiming)
7) **Why it matters** (impact / recommendation)

## A reliable 7‑sentence template
Use this template unless the venue requires a structured abstract.

1. **Context/importance:** 1 sentence.
2. **Gap:** 1 sentence.
3. **Contribution:** 1 sentence starting with “We propose / develop / study …”.
4. **Method essence:** 1 sentence describing the method at a high level.
5. **Evidence:** 1 sentence: “We evaluate via … (theory/simulation/application).”
6. **Main results:** 1 sentence summarizing the *headline* findings.
7. **Closing/impact:** 1 sentence connecting back to the motivating problem.

### Phrase bank (use sparingly)
- “Existing approaches typically assume …; however, …”
- “We develop a method that … while …”
- “We provide theoretical guarantees / derive …”
- “Simulations show … across … scenarios.”
- “In an application to …, we find …”

## Common failure modes
- Opening with “In this paper we …” without explaining why anyone should care.
- Too much detail: notation, tuning parameters, or step-by-step algorithm.
- Vague claims: “performs well” without stating *how* or *relative to what*.
- Including citations or equations.

## Compliance checklist (return with your abstract)
- [ ] 4–10 sentences (default 6–8)
- [ ] No citations (`\cite...`)
- [ ] No math (`$...$`, `\begin{equation}`)
- [ ] Contains: importance → gap → contribution → method → evidence → results → impact

## Output format (LaTeX)
Return:
```tex
\begin{abstract}
...
\end{abstract}
```

If the venue has a structured abstract (Background / Methods / Results / Conclusions), adapt the template but keep the same content.
